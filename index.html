            <li>Players cannot have more than 3 tokens in a row.</li>

            <li>During the Drop Phase, players cannot create three in a row.</li>
            <li>Tokens forming three in a row cannot be removed during the Drop Phase.</li>
            <li>Players cannot capture an opponent's token when it's part of a three in a row they made.</li>
